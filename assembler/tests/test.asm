; this is a counter
; it will count 0 to FFFF in register A
; how many cycles to wait between each count
; is decided by the d register

; start of program

; increases A by 1
COUNTER:
    addi a,1
    subr WAIT
    rjmp COUNTER

; SUBR WAIT
; loops until d = 0
WAIT:
    ldi d,$0FFF
WAIT_LOOP:

; eternity loop
FINISHED:
